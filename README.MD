The Inmate Search and Booking Information System (ISBIS) is a web-based platform designed to provide citizens with easy access to information about individuals arrested and booked in local detention facilities. This system offers features such as inmate search functionality, comprehensive inmate profiles with booking photos, current detention facility information, reasons for arrest, scheduled court dates, and recent transfers. Law enforcement personnel can efficiently manage bookings, update inmate details, and send alerts through the admin panel. ISBIS promotes transparency in the justice system, improves communication between law enforcement and the public, reduces administrative burdens, and enhances data accuracy. Implementing ISBIS requires collaboration with local authorities, data privacy compliance, and a commitment to ongoing maintenance to foster community engagement and trust in the criminal justice system.
